 <p>Turtle farm in Hikkaduwa or Sea Turtle Hatchery & Rescue Center is a small and- yet a very nice turtle farm and rescue center. Here visitors may see turtle eggs which are safely buried in the sand hatchery. It usually takes two days for eggs- to hatch. Turtles are held really gently with great attention to their proper development so that they can later be safely released into the sea where they can live in their natural habitat. This is the- reason why here visitors can see  turtles in many different sizes; turtles need to grow in order to be released and continue living on their own.
    Regrettably, visitors will also be able to see turtles with- mutilated bodily- parts sadly, for instance without forelegs or hind legs . This bodily harm is normally afflicted by boat engines. Once they lose one of their limbs, turtles get off balance and it takes quite some time till they recover in order to have full body command the same as prior to the accident. This is why this farm-is also considered to be a unique shelter that helps disabled turtles to find their body balance and sustain their lives. </p>

    <p>The turtle hatchery is located not far from Hikkaduwa town,only a short tuk tuk ride away. The entrance fee is about LKR 500,but donations is accepted.The injured turtles at the hatchery are followed up by veterinarians. Some can be missing a fin or have open wounds.Adult turtles are at the hatchery to be rehabilitated before being put back into the ocean.Going to the center is a great educational opportunity and allows you- to get up close to the turtles without disturbing their habitat.The eggs har secured behind a netting so birds can not access them.Once the eggs hatch,the baby turtles are placed in a tank until they are ready to be released into the ocean.</p>
    <p>If you're ever in Hikkaduwa, be sure to make a stop at the local sea turtle hatchery ,it's a unique opportunity to get up close and personal with these gentle marine reptiles, while also learning how you can help preserve these wonderful creatures for future generations to enjoy as well!

            The beaches of Sri Lanka are visited by five different species of sea turtle all of which are threatened with extinction due to habitat loss and growing human pressures. Establishments like the Hikkaduwa Sea Turtle Hatchery attempt to combat these issues and provide these marine reptiles with a fighting chance at survival. Here, turtle eggs are collected and kept safe until they are ready to hatch at which point the hatchlings are released into the ocean and old and injured turtles are rehabilitated and given sanctuary. You can observe all of them during your visit too, marvel as the older turtles take it easy and strut about their tanks, and revel as the baby turtle playfully swims about their enclosures, itching to get out into the high seas.
            
            If you visit the hatchery during just the right time, you'll even be able to take part in the baby turtle release process! Watch as these cute little reptiles frantically scuttle away to the waiting ocean, the great blue expanse where they'll spend the rest of their lives in.</p>
