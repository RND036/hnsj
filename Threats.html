<h1>Threats To Turtles</h1>
<br>
<h3>  1.Fisheries bycatch</h3><br>
<div class="threat1">

<p>It is estimated that thousands of sea turtles are injured or killed each year as a result of commercial fishing activity in U.S. and international waters. Many of these injuries and deaths take place while turtles are migrating through fishing areas. The turtles, attracted to the bait, get caught on the hooks used to catch fish.

    As it stands, the global fishing fleet is currently 2.5 times larger than what oceans can sustainably support, which shows how big a threat commercial fishing practices pose to turtles. In 2004, the National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) identified more than 70 fisheries, operating in state and federal waters, as potentially harmful to sea turtles. Turtles are air-breathing reptiles. When they are caught underwater in nets or on lines, they drown if they are unable to reach the surface for air. They can also sustain internal injuries from hooks or external injuries from entanglement, including strangulation or amputation. The ropes used by fisheries can also entangle and drown them.
    
    In the United States, sea turtles are protected under the Endangered Species Act. Beyond U.S. waters, there is no force of law to initiate and support bycatch reduction programs. Nevertheless, the growing international interest in reducing bycatch is motivated by numerous factors such as appreciation for endangered species and concern for maintaining marine biodiversity. The economic interest in preventing future environmentally-based fishing embargoes such as the U.S. tuna embargo (a ban on foreign-caught tuna caught by setting on and killing dolphins) also encourages governments and fishermen to reduce sea turtle capture in fisheries. Bycatch is a serious threat to sea turtles because it can occur anywhere in the ocean, making it hard to implement multi-national agreement that improve equipment requirements.</p>

    <h3> 2. Pollution and Pathogens</h3><br>

    <p>The effects of marine pollution on sea turtles are disturbingly ubiquitous. Several studies have suggested that almost all adult sea turtles will ingest plastic during their lifetime, while countless other turtles will become entangled in discarded fishing gear. These stories have gained considerable attention from the media in recent years, with sea turtles becoming the 'poster child' for the fight against plastic pollution. Yet it is important to remember that if we focus exclusively on marine plastics, we will underestimate the true extent of the pollution problem.Chemical pollutants are just as widespread as marine plastic and we are only beginning to fully understand how they affect marine life. Thousands of oil spills have been documented in sea turtle habitats over the past half a century, yet only in a tiny number of those incidents have the effects on sea turtles been reported. Even in areas far away from any known oil spills, heavy metals, including arsenic and mercury, have been recorded in sea turtles at concentrations far exceeding natural levels. In turn, these pollutants can be passed onto these turtles' offspring and even to humans or other animals that may eat these eggs.</p>

    <h3> 3.climate change</h3><br>
    <div class="threat1">

    <p>Because sea turtles use both marine and terrestrial habitats during their life cycles, the affects of climate change are likely to have a devastating impact on these endangered species. A rise in the sea level will impact sea turtle nesting beaches. Sea turtles' memories are “imprinted” with a magnetic map of the sandy beach where they hatch. This gives them the unique ability to return to that same site decades later to repeat their ancient nesting ritual. With melting polar ice caps and rising sea levels, these beaches are beginning to disappear. The direct impacts of sea level rise include losing beaches, ecologically productive wetlands and barrier islands.An increase in nesting beach temperatures will also have an impact on sea turtles. Because sea turtles are reptiles, they rely on the temperature of the sand in which the eggs incubate to determine the gender of the hatchling in a nest. Typically, the eggs in the lower, cooler, part of the nest will become males, while the eggs in the upper, warmer, part of the nest will become females. With increasing nest temperatures, scientists predict that there will be more female than male hatchlings, creating a significant threat to genetic diversity. Warmer ocean temperatures are also likely to negatively impact food resources for sea turtles, and virtually all marine species. Coral reefs, which are an important food source for sea turtles, are in great danger. Almost half of the coral reef ecosystems in the U.S. are in poor or fair condition. As a result of rising temperatures, coral reefs are suffering from a “bleaching” effect that kills off parts of the reef.</p>

    <h1>**how we can prevent turtles from threat**</h1><br>
    <div class="threat1">

    <img src="./photos/large_leatherback._sandy_point_nwr._shannon_borowy_fws.jpg" alt="" srcset="">
    
    <p>1. Become a conscious and responsible seafood consumer by asking where and how your seafood was caught. Choose seafood caught in ways that do not harm or kill turtles. Consult sustainable seafood information networks to learn about how and where your seafood is caught.
    </p>
    <p>2. Reduce marine debris that may entangle or be accidentally eaten by sea turtles.</p>
    <p>3. Participate in coastal clean-ups and reduce plastic use to keep our beaches and ocean clean.</p>
    <p>4. Carry reusable water bottles and shopping bags.</p>
    <p>5. Sea turtle hatchlings use light and reflections from the moon to find their way to the water at
        night. Artificial lighting confuses the hatchlings and causes them to head inland instead of
        out to sea  putting them in dangerous situations which can lead to death. Artificial lights also
        discourage adult females from nesting on the beach. Short of turning off your lights, you can
        also take measures to shield, redirect and lower the intensity of the lights on your property.</p>
        <p>6. Sea turtles are cute, and therefore tempting to touch and observe but flashlights and
            people disturb turtles when they are nesting, or trying to nest, on the beach. Make sure
            to give nesting areas plenty of space, and do not disturb females as they emerge from the
            ocean looking for a place to nest. Also be conscious of where nesting areas are so that you
            can avoid trampling the hatchlings as they head to the water.</p>
